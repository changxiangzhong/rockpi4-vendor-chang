Android socket model seems to be very strange compared to "normal" sockets.

First, socket has to be initialized via init.rc, given certain permissions.

Next, server application opens it with:

x_con = android_get_control_socket("test");

Next, listen() and fnctl() calls are required:

listen(x_con, 1);
fcntl(x_con, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC);

After that, a LocalSocket connection from Java can access socket, and socket can accept clients.

Setting non-blocking mode later is allowed too:

fnctl(x_con, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);

Other combinations are unnecessary (and there are some guides like Working with the Radio Layer Interface (RIL) in Android - will not link to that low-grade manual - are stating that both socket_local_server and android_get_control_socket are required, which is clearly untrue).
